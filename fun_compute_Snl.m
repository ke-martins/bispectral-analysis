function [ Snl ] = fun_compute_Snl( h0 , f , B )
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Compute the source term 'Snl' for the non-linear energy transfers between triads following Herbers and Burton (1997).
% As discussed in Martins et al. (2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coastaleng.2021.103917), we take the conjugate of the 
% bispectrum B as computed in this toolbox with fun_compute_bispectrum.m in order to be consistent with their Eq. 14.
%
% Inputs:
%   h0 - local mean water depth [m]
%   f  - frequency array [Hz]
%   B  - power bispectrum [m^3], not a density
%
% Notes: f and B arrays are two-sided in regards to f; f should be centered around 0 Hz
%
% Outputs: 
%   Snl - source term for non-linear energy transfers between triads [m^2], size of input f
