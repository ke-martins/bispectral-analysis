function [ Snl ] = fun_compute_Snl( h0 , f , B )
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Compute non-linear 'Snl' term for the energy transfer between triads following Herbers and Burton (1997), see their Eq. 14.
%
% Inputs:
%   h0 - local water depth [m]
%   f  - frequency array [Hz]
%   B  - power bispectrum [m^3], not a density
%
% Notes: f and B arrays are two-sided in regards to f; f should be centered around 0 Hz
%
% Outputs: 
%   Snl - source term for non-linear energy transfers between triads [m^2], size of input f
