function [ v ] = fun_compute_edof( w , Ns , N , overlap )
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Computes the spectral estimate effective degrees of freedom, following Percival and Walden.
%
% Inputs:
%   w       - window (windowed timeseries of FFT length)
%   Ns      - bloc length for the FFT
%   N       - total number of points
%   overlap - overlap in % used to compute number of new points in each FFT
%
% Outputs:
%   v       - effective degrees of freedom in a PSD estimate, following Percival and Walden (1993, their Eq. 292b)
